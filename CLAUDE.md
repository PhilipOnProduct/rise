# Rise — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

Rise is an AI-powered trip planning app. It helps travellers plan trips day-by-day (destination, dates, hotel, itinerary), get smart transport advice (airport → hotel), and discover insider local tips from real residents.

**Business model:** B2C SaaS with a freemium layer. Local guides contribute tips to the platform and earn reputation points; travellers pay for personalised AI recommendations and planning tools.

**Current stage:** Early MVP. Core flows are working end-to-end. Being tested with real users on Vercel.

## Virtual product team

For persona-based discussion (Sarah PM, Maya Designer, Luca Tech Lead, Elena Travel Expert), see `TEAM.md`. When Philip names a teammate ("ask Maya…", "what would Luca say?") or says "the team", respond in-character per that file. Note: TEAM.md's toolkits reference Cowork plugin skills that aren't installed in Claude Code — the personas and POVs apply, but skip the `product-management:*` / `design:*` / `engineering:*` skill invocations.

## Current Features

### Traveller flows
- **Onboarding wizard** (`/welcome`) — 6-step flow: Step 0 full-screen landing (destination) → Step 1 destination + dates → Step 2 hotel (optional — Places autocomplete biased to destination; "I haven't booked yet — skip →" link skips with null hotel; Continue always enabled) → Step 3 travel preferences (company + traveler count + children's ages + style tags + budget tier) → Step 4 AI activity preview (streaming, personalised using Step 3 preferences) → Step 5 account creation (PHI-59: clicking "Send magic link →" PATCHes name + email onto the existing traveler row, saves the local snapshot, calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({email, emailRedirectTo: /auth/callback?next=/dashboard&travelerId=<id>})`, and routes to `/auth/check-email`. The callback links `travelers.auth_user_id` once the user clicks the email. If the OTP send fails, we fall back to `/itinerary` so the user still sees their trip. Name/email inputs have explicit `name` and `autoComplete` attributes to prevent browser autofill cross-contamination). Preferences are written to Supabase via partial upsert when the user advances from Step 3 to Step 4. Saves to Supabase `travelers` table and `localStorage` (`rise_traveler`, `rise_onboarded`). Step 3 has four sections: (1) "Who's coming?" — two side-by-side steppers for Adults (default 2, min 1) and Children (default 0, min 0); when children > 0, age range rows appear below (each child gets "Child N" label + four selectable buttons: Under 2, 2–4, 5–8, 9–12). (2) "Trip type" — dynamic company selector derived from composition: 1 adult + no children → auto-set "solo" (hidden); 2 adults + no children → show Couple / Friend group; 3+ adults + no children → show Friend group / Family; any children → auto-set "family" (hidden). Label hidden when only one option or auto-set. Invalid selection cleared on composition change. (3) Travel style tags — personalised by group type: universal core (Cultural, Food-led, Relaxed, Adventure, Off the beaten track, History) plus group-specific tags (e.g. Romantic for couples, Kid-friendly/Beach/Educational for families, Nightlife/Active/Festivals for friends, Budget-savvy/Slow travel for solo). Tags cleared on company change if no longer available. (4) Budget tier. Children input is available for any trip type. State uses `adultCount` and `childrenAges` array; `travelerCount` is computed as `adultCount + childrenAges.length` at save time.
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — Shows trip summary (destination, dates, nights, hotel, activities) read from `localStorage`. Links to itinerary, transport, profile, and guides.
- **Day-by-day itinerary** (`/itinerary`) — Day-view timeline with one column per trip day, grouped by three time blocks (morning / afternoon / evening) with emoji subheadings and divider lines. AI pre-populates suggestions on first load via `/api/itinerary/generate`; persisted to `localStorage` (`rise_itinerary`). The generate API receives the user's hotel name and injects it into the prompt so activities reference the correct accommodation. Page header shows destination, date range, total days/activities, hotel name, and a "↻ Regenerate" button (with confirmation step). Sticky TripShapeBar highlights the active day via IntersectionObserver. Editing surface: (1) Remove (×) with 5-second undo toast — activity held in state, auto-dismissed after timeout; (2) Swap (⇄) — calls `/api/itinerary/edit` with mode=`swap`, shows new suggestion in place of old item for review ("Looks good ✓" / "Not quite, try again →"), inline error message on API failure; (3) "+ Suggest something" button below each time block and in empty slots — calls `/api/itinerary/edit` with mode=`add`, shows suggestion card for accept/reject review. Action buttons (swap/remove) are always visible on mobile (`opacity-100`), hover-revealed on desktop (`sm:opacity-0 sm:group-hover:opacity-100`). Old item stays visible with loading overlay during API call; new item only committed to state after user confirms. Retry accumulates `rejectedTitles` across attempts. Conflict warning from API shown as amber text. The edit API enforces a hard location constraint — suggestions must be in the destination city, never from another city even if wrong-city items appear in context.
- **Travel connectors** (`/api/itinerary/travel`, `lib/travel-connectors.ts`) — Inter-activity travel time/cost data displayed between every sequential activity pair in the itinerary timeline. User-initiated via "🗺 Calculate travel times" button in the itinerary header. Flow: (1) geocode destination city for location bias; (2) resolve each activity name to coordinates via Google Places Text Search (New); (3) compute walk/transit/drive routes via Google Routes API for each adjacent pair; (4) calculate gap from estimated time positions (block ranges: morning 09:00–12:00, afternoon 13:00–17:00, evening 18:00–21:00, split evenly per activity count); (5) apply family walk-time modifier (1.5× for children Under 2 or 2–4); (6) flag tight connections where fastest travel mode exceeds the gap. All data stored server-side in `travel_connectors` Supabase table, keyed by `traveler_id`. Persists across sessions — loaded on page revisit, only recomputed on explicit trigger. Swap/add/remove trigger targeted refresh of only the affected connectors (1–2 pairs), not the full day. Regenerate clears all connectors. Connector UI: `TravelConnectorRow` component renders between activity cards — compact row showing `🚶 12 min · 🚇 8 min · 🚕 ~2.1 km`. Three visual states: (1) normal — muted text with left-border accent; (2) flagged — amber background with "⚠ Tight connection" heading and flag reason; (3) error — red background, "Travel data unavailable". Zero-duration modes filtered from display. Within-block pairs get a 15-minute minimum gap floor to prevent false flags on short neighbourhood walks. Gap flags stored in DB and logged to `ai_logs` (feature `"travel-connectors"`) for admin visibility as a prompt quality signal — high flag rates across itineraries indicate the AI's neighbourhood-clustering instruction is failing. Admin summary endpoint at `/api/itinerary/travel/admin`. Google API costs: Places Text Search $0.032/req, Routes Compute $0.005/req; full 5-day computation ~$0.70, swap refresh ~$0.06.
- **AI activity preview + feedback** (`/api/activities-stream`, `/api/activity-chips`, `/api/activity-feedback`) — Step 4 of onboarding uses progressive card reveal: the streaming response is parsed incrementally and each complete activity card renders as an `ActivityCard` immediately (no raw markdown shown). Cards show title, category, and description (no "When:" line). Cards are interactive immediately as they stream in — thumbs are not disabled during streaming; a "Found N of ~6 activities..." progress counter shows below the last card while loading. Thumbs up/down are toggleable — tapping the active thumb deselects it (returns to neutral); tapping the other thumb switches. Selected thumbs-up renders with solid teal fill. Chips are pre-generated on card render (not on tap) by calling `/api/activity-chips` — Claude Haiku with tool_use, returns 1 hard-exclusion ("Done it before") + 3 profile-specific soft-signal reasons + 1 static "Not for me" soft-signal appended as fallback. All chips have identical unselected styling (no orange on "Done it before" until selected). FALLBACK_CHIPS (3 static chips + "Not for me") are shown immediately on thumbs-down tap; dynamic chips swap in silently once loaded (guarded by `submittedActivitiesRef` so they never disrupt in-progress interactions). Chip selection is required — a "← Undo" link closes the chip layer and returns the card to neutral (allowing a thumbs-up instead), but no skip path exists. Chip selection: hard-exclusion shows "We'll skip this." and blocks the activity; soft-signal shows "👎 Noted — we'll adjust." with an amber left border on the card. Step 5 shows a "Skipped activities" panel of hard-excluded activities with × removal buttons (logs `exclusion_removed`). All interactions (thumbs_up, chips_shown, chip_selected, exclusion_removed) are logged to `activity_feedback` via `/api/activity-feedback` with `chipsSource` (fallback/dynamic) and `firstChipLabel`. On finish, feedback saved to `rise_activity_feedback` in localStorage and consumed by `/api/itinerary/generate` with two main cases: (1) hard exclusions → "NEVER include" block; (2) soft with reason → "avoid, suggest alternatives". A "N of M rated" counter shows above the cards once the user starts rating. CTA button: disabled until at least one rating; shows "Continue with N rated — more = better results →" when fewer than half are rated, "Continue with N rated →" otherwise. Activity diversity is enforced in the stream prompt — each of the ~6 activities must come from a different category (food & dining, cultural/historic, outdoor/adventure, nightlife/entertainment, relaxation/wellness, shopping/local markets). The prompt also instructs Claude never to reference the traveller's profile or preferences in descriptions.
- **AI activity suggestions** (`/api/activities`) — POSTs destination to Claude, returns 20 categorised activities as JSON.
- **Airport → Hotel transport** (`/transport`) — Streaming AI advice comparing public transport vs taxi for a given airport/hotel/city.
- **Travel profile & restaurant recommendations** (`/profile`) — Collects traveller type, destination, dates, company, budget, dietary wishes. Streams personalised restaurant picks from Claude.
- **User feedback** (`/feedback`) — Full-page form. Page field auto-filled with current URL (editable). Saves to `user_feedback` Supabase table. Confirmation screen after submit.
- **Floating feedback button** — Fixed bottom-right on every page except `/welcome` and `/team*`. Opens a popup with textarea + send. Auto-captures current pathname. Shows "Thanks!" confirmation then closes.
- **Magic-link auth** (PHI-59, `/signin`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/check-email`) — Passwordless Supabase Auth via `@supabase/ssr` with cookie-based sessions. `/signin` collects email and calls `signInWithOtp({email, emailRedirectTo: /auth/callback?next=/dashboard})`; the user is redirected to `/auth/check-email?email=<...>` with a 30-second resend cooldown and link-expiry hints. `/auth/callback` is a Route Handler (GET) that calls `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)`, then — if the link carried a `travelerId` (set during welcome Step 5) — links the row via `update travelers set auth_user_id = <user.id> where id = <travelerId> and auth_user_id is null` (best-effort; failure doesn't lock the user out of their account). On success redirects to `next` (default `/dashboard`); on missing/expired code redirects to `/signin?error=expired`. Allowlisted in `middleware.ts` so the email link works even without the `site_auth` cookie. Coexists with `SITE_PASSWORD` middleware as orthogonal layers — site password gates platform access, Supabase Auth gates per-user account features. **Email template requires manual setup in Supabase dashboard** — DM Sans body, teal `#1a6b7f` CTA, subject "Sign in to Rise". Default 1h link expiry. New users are auto-created (`shouldCreateUser` defaults to `true`). No new Anthropic API calls. Claim flow for legacy localStorage-only travellers is deferred to PHI-B; RLS hardening to PHI-C.

### Local guide flows
- **Browse guides** (`/guides`) — City search landing page.
- **City tips** (`/guides/[city]`) — Lists all tips for a city with guide name, reputation badge, and star rating button. Increments view count on load; awards 15 points at 10 views.
- **Submit a tip** (`/guides/add`) — Form to add a local tip. Find-or-creates guide by email in `guides` table, inserts tip with `guide_id`, awards 10 points.
- **Rate a tip** (`/api/tips/[id]/rate`) — POST inserts into `tip_ratings`, awards 25 points to the guide. Duplicate prevention via `localStorage`.
- **Leaderboard** (`/guides/leaderboard`) — Top 10 guides ranked by points with level badges.

### Reputation / points system
- Levels: 🌱 Explorer (0–49 pts) · 📍 Local (50–199) · 🔑 Insider (200–499) · ⭐ Legend (500+)
- Events: submit tip (+10), tip reaches 10 views (+15), traveller rates tip (+25)

### Admin
- **AI Logs** (`/admin`) — Table of all Claude API calls with prompt, input, output, latency, token counts, and per-log rating/notes for evaluation. Team discussion titles strip markdown asterisks from display.
- **User feedback** (`/feedback-admin`) — All `user_feedback` entries ordered by most recent, with page URL, feedback text, and date.
- **Evals** (`/admin/evals`) — Three-level evaluation framework for AI output quality. Four tabs: (1) Test cases — lists pre-seeded family prompt scenarios with criteria tags; (2) Run evals — select a test case via `CustomSelect` dropdown, run against `/api/itinerary/generate`, view output, rate 1-5 with notes, "Ask Claude to judge →" for LLM-as-judge scoring with per-criterion pass/fail breakdown; (3) Results — sortable table of all eval results (test case, model, human score, LLM score, date); (4) Model comparison — select test case + Model A/B, run both in parallel, side-by-side output with auto-judging and win/loss summary. All dropdowns use `CustomSelect` (div-based, not native select) to avoid browser event issues. Data stored in `eval_test_cases` and `eval_results` Supabase tables. Judge route at `/api/evals/judge` calls Claude with structured scoring prompt.
- **Usage** (`/admin/usage`) — API usage monitoring and limits dashboard. Two provider cards (Anthropic, Google) each showing: progress bar (spent/limit), warning level indicator (green/amber/red), current month spend, estimated month-end projection. Editable limit fields: monthly limit USD, warning threshold %, hard limit toggle — saves via `PATCH /api/usage/limits`. Recent usage log table (last 50 entries): date, provider, api_type, feature, tokens/requests, cost — sortable by date or cost.

### Product team (`/team`) — four tabs
- **Build / Research mode toggle** — Persistent toggle in the page header (all tabs). Default: Build mode. Stored in `localStorage("rise_team_mode")`. Teal dot = Build mode, amber dot = Research mode. The active mode is injected as an `IMPORTANT:` instruction into every agent system prompt: Sarah (framing, synthesis, PRD), Alex, Maya, Luca, Elena, PM Sarah, and the product coach. Build mode instructs agents to ship complete features without research gates or phased rollouts; Research mode applies standard discovery practices.
- **Card types** — Each objective has a `card_type` field: `objective` (teal), `improvement` (amber), `bug` (red). Type badges shown on kanban cards, detail panel, and PM tab objective list. `CardTypeSelector` component used when creating cards from the kanban "+ New card" form. PM tab always creates `objective` type cards.
- **Kanban tab** — Board with four columns (Backlog / Refine / Implement / Done). Status values: `backlog` | `refine` | `implement` | `done`. "+ New card" button above the board opens an inline form (title + description + type selector) for directly creating Backlog cards — Bugs and Improvements are created here without PM conversation. Cards are sourced from the `objectives` table grouped by status. Each card: type badge + title (line-clamp-2, markdown asterisks stripped), description (line-clamp-2), PRD/discussion count indicators, drag-and-drop to move between columns (HTML5 `draggable`; Done column is read-only), delete with confirmation. Clicking a card opens the Card Detail Panel (slide-in). Column highlights with `bg-[#1a6b7f]/5 ring-1 ring-[#1a6b7f]/20` on dragover. Columns use solid `border-[#c8c3bb]` borders; headers use `text-[#4a6580]`. Container uses `grid grid-cols-4` and `overflow-x-hidden` on `<main>` to prevent horizontal page scroll. `refreshKey` state triggers re-fetch when cards are modified elsewhere.
- **Card detail panel** — Slide-in panel (right side, `fixed z-50`) opened by clicking a kanban card. Shows: card title, type badge, status badge, created date, description, PM conversation summary (`pm_summary`), team discussions list (date + summary, expandable to full transcript), "Start team discussion →" button (visible for refine cards — opens full-screen modal), expandable PRD, copyable Claude Code prompt. Claude Code result textarea only shown on `implement`/`done` cards (hidden on `backlog`/`refine`). "Move to [next status] →" button with inline confirmation when moving Refine → Implement without any discussions ("No team discussion has been run for this card. Move to Implement anyway?" Yes/No). Delete button. `NEXT_STATUS` map: backlog→refine, refine→implement, implement→done.
- **Team discussion flow** — "Start team discussion →" opens a full-screen modal (`fixed inset-0 z-[60]`) containing the complete `ProductTeamTab` with card context. Full card context (`buildCardContext()`) injected into all agent system prompts: title, type, description, pm_summary, previous discussion summaries, PRD, Claude Code result. After discussion + PRD generates, "Save to card →" closes the modal and returns to the card detail panel with the new discussion visible. Discussion stored as summary + full transcript + PRD in the card's `discussions` jsonb array.
- **Alex in Build/Research mode** — In Build mode (`buildMode=true`), Alex (Researcher) is excluded from the parallel specialist calls in team discussions. Only included when `buildMode=false` (Research mode). The team roster display, synthesis prompt, PRD prompt, discussion output rendering, and download conversation contributors line all respect this flag.
- **Markdown rendering** — Agent, coach, and PM chat bubbles use the `MarkdownText` component (defined in `team/page.tsx`) to render markdown: `##`/`###` as bold headings, `**text**` as bold, `---` as horizontal rules, `-`/`*` as bullet lists, numbered lists. Kanban card titles and admin discussion titles strip `**`/`*` via `.replace(/\*+/g, "")`.
- **Product team tab** — Multi-agent discussion: Sarah (PM) frames the problem (2048 tokens), Alex/Maya/Luca/Elena respond in parallel (2048 tokens each), Sarah synthesises (4096 tokens). Generates PRD (8000 tokens). If launched from a card (`cardContext`), shows a card context banner and "Save to card →" button after completion. If launched without card context, "Save to Kanban →" creates a new card. Sarah's memory persisted in `agent_memory` table. Saves to `team_conversations` (type=`"team"`). PRD generation instructs Claude to write a Claude Code Implementation Prompt section: functional description of what to build, hard constraints on sequencing/data flow only — no acceptance criteria, copy templates, animation details, schema details, manual testing instructions, QA steps, or scenario-based testing requirements (Claude Code cannot run these; quality validation is the founder's responsibility). Synthesis and PRD generation both use `sarahSystemWithMemory` (Sarah's base system prompt + build mode instruction + rolling memory). PRD sections: Overview / Problem Statement / User Need / Proposed Solution / User Stories / Success Metrics / Technical Considerations (strategic only — no implementation details) / Risks & Open Questions / Claude Code Implementation Prompt.
- **PM tab** — 1-on-1 conversation with Sarah (PM). Chat UI with streaming responses. On mount, fetches full CLAUDE.md content from `/api/rise-context` and injects it into the system prompt. Saves conversations to `team_conversations` (type=`"pm"`). Past conversations browsable via `PastConversations`. "View Kanban →" button next to the Agreed objectives heading switches to the Kanban tab. Auto-detect objective agreement: `detectObjectiveAgreed()` checks Sarah's last message for trigger phrases ("shall we save that", "want me to add that to the kanban", etc.). When detected, an "Add to Kanban as Objective →" button appears. Clicking it auto-extracts title (max 8 words) and description (1 sentence) from the conversation via Claude, generates a 3-5 sentence `pm_summary`, and saves to `objectives` with `status="backlog"` and `card_type="objective"`. No manual input or type selector — PM conversations always create Objectives. Sarah's system prompt instructs her to use agreement phrases when an objective is agreed.
- **Product coach tab** — 1-on-1 with a product coach (Claude Opus 4.6). Full conversation history maintained; saved to `team_conversations` (type=`"coach"`).
- **Past conversations** (`PastConversations` component, used in all three chat tabs) — Expandable panel listing saved conversations. Each row has a hover-revealed `×` delete button; clicking shows inline "Delete this conversation? Yes / No" confirmation, then deletes from `team_conversations` and removes from local state. The currently active conversation cannot be deleted (no button shown, shows `· Active` label instead). Coach and PM tabs track `conversationId` in both a `useRef` (for in-flight updates) and a `useState` (to pass as `activeConversationId` prop).

### Infrastructure
- **Password protection** — Edge middleware (`middleware.ts`) redirects unauthenticated users to `/api/auth`. GET shows the form; POST sets an `httpOnly` cookie.
- **AI logging** (`lib/ai-logger.ts`) — Wraps every Claude call; logs to Supabase `ai_logs` table.
- **API usage logging** (`lib/log-api-usage.ts`, `lib/api-costs.ts`) — Every API route calls `logApiUsage()` after a successful external API call. Calculates estimated cost from pricing constants (Sonnet $3/$15 per 1M tokens, Opus $15/$75, Haiku $0.80/$4, Google Places $0.017/req, Places Text Search $0.032/req, Routes Compute $0.005/req, Geocoding $0.005/req). Inserts to `api_usage` table. `checkApiLimit(provider)` queries current month spend vs `api_limits` table, returns `{ allowed, warningLevel, percentUsed, spentUsd, limitUsd }`. Hard limit enforcement: every Anthropic route calls `checkApiLimit("anthropic")` before the API call and returns 429 if exceeded and `hard_limit_enabled` is true. The travel connectors endpoint calls `checkApiLimit("google")` before computing. Wired into: itinerary/generate, itinerary/edit, itinerary/travel, activities-stream, recommendations, transport, evals/judge, activity-chips, team/chat.
- **Travel connector logic** (`lib/travel-connectors.ts`) — Server-side functions for coordinate resolution (Google Places Text Search), route computation (Google Routes API), activity time estimation from block positions, family walk-time modifier (1.5× for Under 2 / 2–4 age bands), gap calculation with within-block minimum floor (15 min), and flag determination. `buildConnectorRow()` assembles a complete DB row from route results, gap data, and family modifier. Used exclusively by `/api/itinerary/travel`.
- **API limit banner** (`ApiLimitBanner.tsx`) — Client component in `layout.tsx` above Nav. Fetches `/api/usage/status` on mount. Amber banner at ≥80% spend ("You've used X% of your budget"), red banner when exceeded ("API limit reached. AI features are paused."). Links to `/admin/usage`. Dismissible per session via `sessionStorage`.
- **Shared Supabase client** (`lib/supabase.ts`) — Single client instance used everywhere.
- **Rise context API** (`/api/rise-context`) — Server-side GET route that reads and returns `CLAUDE.md` as JSON using Node `fs`. Used by the PM tab to inject the full product context into the system prompt.
- **Traveler composition** (`lib/composition.ts`) — `buildCompositionSegment(travelerCount, childrenAges)` builds a plain-language context segment injected into every AI prompt. Translates age ranges to behavioural constraints: Under 2 → pram access required, nap windows mid-morning/afternoon, no loud environments; 2–4 → 45-min activity max, outdoor space; 5–8 → 90-min tolerance, interactive; 9–12 → near-adult stamina. Constraints are deduplicated across siblings. Used in activities-stream, itinerary/generate, itinerary/edit, recommendations, and transport routes.
- **Prompt caching** — Static system prompt instructions are separated into a `system` array with `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` on the streaming routes (activities-stream, recommendations, transport). Dynamic per-request context goes in the user message. Caches once the static portion reaches Anthropic's threshold (~1024 tokens).
- **Eval scripts** — `npm run eval:family` runs `scripts/eval-family-prompts.ts`: tests `buildCompositionSegment` against 7 family scenarios (solo, Under 2, 9–12, mixed, beach/city/adventure destinations) with 20 assertions. Exits with code 1 on failure. `npm run eval:recommendations` runs the restaurant recommendations eval. `npm run eval:location` runs `scripts/eval-itinerary-location.ts`: tests `/api/itinerary/edit` location constraint with 5 trap cases (wrong-city items in context — e.g. Eiffel Tower in Amsterdam, Pergamon Museum in Lisbon), uses Claude Sonnet as LLM-as-judge to verify suggestions stay in the destination city. Requires dev server running.

## Supabase Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `travelers` | Onboarding data — destination, dates, hotel, activities, account, traveler_count (int), children_ages (text[]), travel_company (text), style_tags (text[]), budget_tier (text), auth_user_id (uuid, FK → auth.users.id, PHI-59). Name and email are nullable (collected at step 5, after row creation). `auth_user_id` is null until the user clicks the magic link; nullable so existing localStorage-only travellers keep working. |
| `guides` | Local guide profiles — email, name, points |
| `tips` | Guide tips — city, content, view count, guide_id |
| `tip_ratings` | One row per rating event — tip_id, value |
| `ai_logs` | Every Claude API call — prompt, input, output, latency, tokens, rating, notes |
| `team_conversations` | Product agent conversations — type (`team`/`coach`/`pm`), title, messages JSON, prd |
| `agent_memory` | Sarah's rolling memory of past product discussions — id=`"sarah"`, content |
| `prd_feedback` | Feedback on generated PRDs — conversation_id, feedback text |
| `objectives` | PM 1-on-1 agreed objectives — title, description (1-sentence), prd (full PRD text), status (`backlog`/`refine`/`implement`/`done`), card_type (`objective`/`improvement`/`bug`), pm_summary (text), claude_code_result (text), discussions (jsonb array of {date, summary, transcript, prd}) |
| `user_feedback` | Floating button + /feedback form submissions — page URL, feedback text |
| `activity_feedback` | Activity preview interaction log — event type, activity name/category, chip label/type |
| `itinerary_items` | Persisted restaurant alternatives from swap feature — item details, booking_meta, replaced_restaurant |
| `activity_feedback` | Activity preview interaction log — event, activity name/category, chip label/type, chips_source (fallback/dynamic), first_chip_label |
| `eval_test_cases` | Eval test scenarios — name, feature, inputs (jsonb), criteria (text[]). Pre-seeded with 7 family prompt scenarios |
| `eval_results` | Eval run results — test_case_id (FK), model, prompt_used, ai_output, human_score (1-5), human_notes, llm_score (1-5), llm_reasoning |
| `api_usage` | API call cost tracking — provider (`anthropic`/`google`), api_type, feature, input_tokens, output_tokens, request_count, estimated_cost_usd |
| `api_limits` | Per-provider monthly limits — provider (unique), monthly_limit_usd, warning_threshold_pct (default 80), hard_limit_enabled (default true) |
| `travel_connectors` | Inter-activity travel data — traveler_id, day_number, sequence_index, from/to activity IDs and names, from/to lat/lng, walk/transit/drive seconds and meters, walk_adjusted_seconds (family modifier), transit_fare, gap_seconds, gap_flagged (bool), flag_reason, error. Indexed on traveler_id. |

## Coding Conventions

### TypeScript
- Strict mode is on. No `any` unless genuinely unavoidable (e.g. runtime Google Maps types not covered by `@types/google.maps`).
- Use SDK types directly (`NextRequest`, `NextResponse`, Supabase generics). Don't redefine what the libraries already export.

### Design system (light theme)
- **Background:** `#f8f6f1` (page), `white` (cards), `#f0ede8` (subtle fills)
- **Borders:** `#e8e4de` (card borders), `#d4cfc5` (dividers/separators), `#c8c3bb` (kanban column borders)
- **Accent:** `#1a6b7f` (teal) — buttons, active states, focus rings, links
- **Text:** Three tokens defined as CSS custom properties in `app/globals.css` `:root` and consumed via Tailwind arbitrary values. Do NOT introduce new ad-hoc grey shades for text — pick the nearest token by perceptual lightness.
  - `--text-primary: #0e2a47` → `text-[var(--text-primary)]` — headings, strong text, body emphasis
  - `--text-secondary: #4a6580` → `text-[var(--text-secondary)]` — body copy, labels, sub-headings
  - `--text-muted: #5a6f7f` → `text-[var(--text-muted)]` — hints, timestamps, metadata, placeholders. Bumped from `#6a7f8f` for AA contrast on cream `#f8f6f1`.
- **Border radius:** `rounded-2xl` for cards and primary buttons, `rounded-xl` for inputs
- **Font:** DM Sans — already applied globally via `layout.tsx`. Don't add other fonts.
- Primary buttons: `bg-[#1a6b7f] text-white font-bold rounded-2xl hover:bg-[#155a6b]`
- Status badges (kanban/PM tab): Backlog `bg-[#e8f0f4] text-[#1a6b7f]`, Refine `bg-[#e8f0fb] text-[#185fa5]`, In-Progress `bg-[#fef3e2] text-[#ba7517]`, Done `bg-[#eaf4ee] text-[#2d7a4f]`

### AI / Anthropic
- Default model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- **The activity-gen prompt lives in `lib/activity-gen-prompt.ts`.** Both `app/api/activities-stream/route.ts` and `scripts/eval-activities.ts` import `ACTIVITY_GEN_SYSTEM` and `buildActivityGenUserMessage()` from there. Edit there, not in the route or the eval — they're the same string by construction (PHI-43).
- Use streaming (`client.messages.stream()`) for any response displayed progressively (recommendations, transport advice, onboarding activity preview). Use `stream.finalMessage()` to get the complete response afterwards.
- Use non-streaming (`client.messages.create()`) when the response must be parsed as structured JSON (e.g. itinerary generation). Always wrap `JSON.parse()` in try/catch and return a meaningful error.
- Always wrap Claude calls with `logAiInteraction` from `lib/ai-logger.ts` so every interaction is logged to `/admin`. Also call `logApiUsage()` from `lib/log-api-usage.ts` after each successful call for cost tracking. Call `checkApiLimit("anthropic")` at the start of each route and return 429 if exceeded.
- For welcome-flow routes (parse-trip, activities-stream, itinerary-generate), always pass `session_id: req.cookies.get("rise_session_id")?.value ?? null` to `logAiInteraction`. PHI-40 uses this to group calls by trip in the multi-leg cost report.

### Eval harnesses
- `npm run eval:parser` — runs the 50-case free-form parser eval. Run before any prompt edit in `app/api/parse-trip/route.ts`. Pass gate: ≥85% field accuracy, 100% on constraint preservation.
- `npm run eval:activities` — runs the 30-case activity-gen eval (15 single-leg + 15 multi-leg). Run before any prompt edit in `lib/activity-gen-prompt.ts`. Pass gate: ≥85% field accuracy, 0 life-impacting failures.
- Both evals call the live Anthropic API and cost ~$1–2 per run on Sonnet 4.6. Keep `lib/api-costs.ts` rates current.
- **`eval:activities` uses `temperature: 0.2`** (PHI-42). Default temperature gave noisy results on "every card mentions X" checks — same prompt, different runs, different failures. PHI-42 trialled `{0.2, 0.5, default}` × `{strict check, ≥(N−1) loosened check}` — temp 0.2 with the strict check produced the best result (1 life-impacting failure vs 2–3 at other configs). The dominant remaining failure is the 9-card multi-leg-allergy case where Sonnet drops the constraint mention on 1 of 9 cards stochastically; that's a model variance ceiling on this prompt, not a prompt bug. Filed as a known limitation; revisit only if traffic signals it matters in production. The production route at `app/api/activities-stream/route.ts` stays at default temperature so real users still see variation.

### Cost telemetry (PHI-40)
- `npm run report:multi-leg-cost` — reads `ai_logs`, groups by `session_id`, computes per-trip Anthropic cost, splits single-leg vs multi-leg, prints median + p95 + ratio.
- **Decision rule:** if multi-leg / single-leg median cost ratio crosses **2.5×**, revisit prompt caching, smaller-model fallback for low-stakes calls, or per-leg parallel generation. The script flags this automatically; no auto-rollback.
- Run on demand — not wired into CI. Sensible cadence: after any prompt edit in `/api/activities-stream` or `/api/itinerary/generate`, and weekly during multi-leg adoption.
- When Claude returns JSON, strip markdown code fences before parsing: `.replace(/^```(?:json)?\s*/i, "").replace(/\s*```\s*$/, "").trim()`
- Set `max_tokens` generously for structured JSON responses — truncated JSON causes parse failures. Use 8000+ for multi-day itineraries.
- JSON parse fallback: if primary parse fails, try extracting between `indexOf("{")` and `lastIndexOf("}")` before giving up.

### Supabase error logging
Supabase `PostgrestError` properties are non-enumerable — `console.error(error)` prints `{}`. Use the `dbErr()` helper in `app/team/page.tsx` to extract `.message`, `.code`, `.details`, `.hint`:
```ts
function dbErr(err: unknown): string {
  if (!err || typeof err !== "object") return String(err);
  const e = err as Record<string, unknown>;
  return [e.message, e.code, e.details, e.hint].filter(Boolean).join(" | ") || JSON.stringify(err);
}
```

### PlacesAutocomplete
- `hasTypedRef` — prevents the dropdown from opening on mount when a pre-filled value is passed in. Only flips `true` on the input's own `onChange`.
- `justSelectedRef` — suppresses the suggestions effect for one cycle after a selection is made, preventing the dropdown from reopening when `onSelect` updates the controlled value.

### Supabase
- Always import the client from `lib/supabase.ts`. Never create a new client inline.
- Use `.single()` when expecting one row; check the `error` field before using `data`.
- Points are incremented with a read-then-write pattern (read current `points`, add, write back). Good enough for MVP; migrate to Supabase RPC for production.

### Next.js / React
- Prefer Server Components by default. Add `"use client"` only when the component needs `useState`, `useEffect`, browser APIs, or event handlers.
- Page-level data fetching goes in the route handler (`/api/...`), not directly in Server Components calling Supabase.
- Use `next/link` (`Link`) for internal navigation, not `<a href>`.
- Step animations: `key={animKey}` on the container + `animate-step` CSS class triggers `fadeSlideUp` keyframe defined in `globals.css`.
- Use `AbortController` + `signal` for streaming fetch calls inside `useEffect` so the stream is cancelled cleanly on unmount or dependency change.

### localStorage keys
| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `rise_traveler` | Full traveller object (name, email, destination, dates, hotel, travelCompany, travelerCount, childrenAges, travelerTypes, budgetTier, activities) |
| `rise_onboarded` | `"true"` — gates redirect from `/welcome` to `/dashboard` |
| `rise_itinerary` | Cached `ItineraryDay[]` array — cleared and regenerated when user clicks Regenerate |
| `rise_team_mode` | `"build"` or `"research"` — persists the Build/Research mode toggle on `/team` |
| `rise_activity_feedback` | `ActivityFeedbackEntry[]` — thumbs-ups and chip selections from the activity preview; consumed by itinerary generation |

### Auth / middleware
- **Two orthogonal layers** (PHI-59):
  - **Site password gate** — `middleware.ts` + `app/api/auth/route.ts`. Cookie `site_auth` is an HMAC token (see `lib/auth.ts`); not the password itself. Gates platform access during private beta.
  - **Supabase Auth (per-user)** — `@supabase/ssr` cookie-based sessions. Gates per-user account features. New users sign up via welcome Step 5 magic link; returning users via `/signin`. Sessions live in httpOnly cookies and refresh transparently.
- The middleware matcher excludes `_next/static`, `_next/image`, `favicon.ico`, `api/auth`, and **`auth/callback`** (PHI-59 — magic-link landing must work behind the site-password gate so a user clicking the email on a fresh device doesn't lose their `code` query param).
- Use `getSupabaseServerClient()` from `lib/supabase-server.ts` in Server Components / Route Handlers when you need `auth.uid()`; use `getSupabaseBrowserClient()` from `lib/supabase-browser.ts` in client components. The legacy `supabase` export in `lib/supabase.ts` carries no auth context and is fine for non-RLS reads/writes (admin tables, anonymous-session writes, AI logs). Once PHI-C lands RLS, most callers will need to migrate.
- Email template (subject, body, CTA) is configured in the **Supabase dashboard**, not in code. It must use DM Sans body + teal `#1a6b7f` CTA per PRD; replace the default Supabase boilerplate before exposing to real users.
- `signInWithOtp` defaults to `shouldCreateUser: true` — both signin and signup go through the same flow; new users are auto-created in `auth.users` on first verification.

---

## Environment Variables

These must be set in `.env.local` (development) and Vercel project settings (production):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY=
SITE_PASSWORD=
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are exposed to the browser. Keep API keys that should stay server-side without the prefix.
- `SITE_PASSWORD` — the password for the whole-site access gate. Leave unset to disable password protection entirely.
