# Rise — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

Rise is an AI-powered trip planning app. It helps travellers plan trips day-by-day (destination, dates, hotel, itinerary), get smart transport advice (airport → hotel), and discover insider local tips from real residents.

**Business model:** B2C SaaS with a freemium layer. Local guides contribute tips to the platform and earn reputation points; travellers pay for personalised AI recommendations and planning tools.

**Current stage:** Early MVP. Core flows are working end-to-end. Deployed to Vercel for Philip's own testing — there is no real-user traffic yet.

**No real-user traffic — frame instrumentation as readiness, not measurement.** Rise's only traffic is Philip's own test walks. Don't write PRDs, success metrics, or open questions that depend on real-user funnel data ("drop-off rates", "click-through rates", "% of users who…", projected user counts, weekly active users). Frame analytics, metrics, A/B-testing, or observability work as "get the plumbing in place so it's ready when traffic arrives" and verify each piece against Philip's own walks. When real users start using Rise, this convention changes — Philip will update this line.

## Virtual product team

For persona-based discussion (Sarah PM, Maya Designer, Luca Tech Lead, Elena Travel Expert), see `TEAM.md`. When Philip names a teammate ("ask Maya…", "what would Luca say?") or says "the team", respond in-character per that file. Note: TEAM.md's toolkits reference Cowork plugin skills that aren't installed in Claude Code — the personas and POVs apply, but skip the `product-management:*` / `design:*` / `engineering:*` skill invocations.

## Linear issue workflow

Issue tracking lives in Linear (team `Philip On Product`). The canonical workflow — column meanings, label conventions, PRD requirements, handoff and close-the-loop steps — is in `KANBAN.md`. Read it before picking up or closing an issue.

**Claude Code owns the state transitions** when working an issue from the terminal:

- **On pickup** — first action, before grepping or writing any code, is to move the card to **In Progress** via the Linear MCP (`save_issue` with `id` and `state: "In Progress"`). Idempotent: skip if already In Progress. This way the kanban reflects reality the moment work starts.
- **On close** — once `npm run build` passes and the change has been walked on the code path the diff runs on: `git commit` + `git push origin main` so the diff reaches the remote (Rise pushes direct to main; Vercel auto-deploys). Then confirm the deployed bundle contains the diff — fingerprint the served bundle for a marker string from the change, or check the Vercel deploy SHA matches the commit. Then `save_comment` with What changed (incl. commit SHA) / What was tested (incl. fingerprint result) / What's deferred, then move the card to **Done** via `save_issue`. Without the push and the deploy verification, "Done" is a lie. Past incident: PHI-79 shipped Done with the diff still in the local working tree — never reached prod. The walk starts from the user's actual entry point (usually `/`, not the route touched).
- **What counts as walking the change.** Walking from `/` is necessary but not sufficient. If the diff is in an authenticated branch, walk while signed in. If it's behind a feature flag, walk with the flag on. If it's only reachable from a specific entry point (homepage parser, dashboard switcher, magic-link landing), walk from there. A build pass plus a partial walk that doesn't exercise the diff is not walking the change — it ships broken code with green checks. Past incident: PHI-51 nearly shipped Done before someone caught that `/` bypassed the parser entirely for signed-in users — the fix lived in the parser route, but the actual entry path was the homepage form, which never reached the parser.
- **Confirm the build under test contains the diff before concluding the fix is broken.** Vercel deploys can lag, edge caches can serve previous builds, and the production URL may not point at the latest commit when you fetch. If a post-merge walk shows pre-fix behaviour, fingerprint the served bundle first: grep for a marker string from the fix (a new function name, a unique routing target like `/auth/claim?next=/dashboard`), or check the deploy SHA in the Vercel dashboard. If the bundle does not contain the diff, you're walking stale code — investigate the deploy, do **not** reopen the issue. Past incident: PHI-74 walked on Vercel after merge observed pre-fix behaviour and was incorrectly reopened with a wrong diagnosis; the deployed bundle was actually a previous build. The original fix in `handleFinish()` was correct — it does fire on the signed-in path via an auto-finish `useEffect` at `app/welcome/page.tsx:1048` that runs `handleFinish()` synchronously when `step → 5` with `authedUser?.existingName` (Step 5's UI is suppressed for that user but the function still runs). For signed-in walks where this matters, use the cookie-mint approach against local dev rather than fighting Vercel state.
- **Defer only what's technically infeasible.** Verification steps that legitimately need a real email round-trip, third-party billing, or external services Claude Code cannot trigger are deferrable to a manual walk by Philip. Steps that are merely inconvenient — signing in, setting up a fixture, walking a longer path — are **not** deferrable. Walk them. If a fixture is missing, build it.
- **If blocked** — `save_comment` with what was tried and what's blocking, leave the card In Progress (don't move backwards). Philip decides whether to bounce it back to Todo or scope it down.

## Current Features

### Traveller flows
- **Onboarding wizard** (`/welcome`) — 6-step flow: Step 0 full-screen landing (destination) → Step 1 destination + dates → Step 2 hotel (optional — Places autocomplete biased to destination; "I haven't booked yet — skip →" link skips with null hotel; Continue always enabled) → Step 3 travel preferences (company + traveler count + children's ages + style tags + budget tier) → Step 4 AI activity preview (streaming, personalised using Step 3 preferences) → Step 5 account creation (PHI-59: clicking "Send magic link →" PATCHes name + email onto the existing traveler row, saves the local snapshot, calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({email, emailRedirectTo: /auth/callback?next=/dashboard&travelerId=<id>})`, and routes to `/auth/check-email`. The callback links `travelers.auth_user_id` once the user clicks the email. If the OTP send fails, we fall back to `/itinerary` so the user still sees their trip. Name/email inputs have explicit `name` and `autoComplete` attributes to prevent browser autofill cross-contamination. PHI-74: when the user is already signed in (Supabase session present, `authedUser` non-null), the handler PATCHes name+email and saves the local snapshot as before but then routes to `/auth/claim?next=/dashboard` instead of sending a magic link or pushing straight to `/dashboard` — the PHI-60 conflict UI reconciles the new trip against any existing primary trip on the account, and the claim API owns linking `auth_user_id` as part of the chosen action. `localStorage.rise_traveler` is preserved across the hand-off because `/auth/claim` reads it). Preferences are written to Supabase via partial upsert when the user advances from Step 3 to Step 4. Saves to Supabase `travelers` table and `localStorage` (`rise_traveler`, `rise_onboarded`). Step 3 has four sections: (1) "Who's coming?" — two side-by-side steppers for Adults (default 2, min 1) and Children (default 0, min 0); when children > 0, age range rows appear below (each child gets "Child N" label + four selectable buttons: Under 2, 2–4, 5–8, 9–12). (2) "Trip type" — dynamic company selector derived from composition: 1 adult + no children → auto-set "solo" (hidden); 2 adults + no children → show Couple / Friend group; 3+ adults + no children → show Friend group / Family; any children → auto-set "family" (hidden). Label hidden when only one option or auto-set. Invalid selection cleared on composition change. (3) Travel style tags — personalised by group type: universal core (Cultural, Food-led, Relaxed, Adventure, Off the beaten track, History) plus group-specific tags (e.g. Romantic for couples, Kid-friendly/Beach/Educational for families, Nightlife/Active/Festivals for friends, Budget-savvy/Slow travel for solo). Tags cleared on company change if no longer available. (4) Budget tier. Children input is available for any trip type. State uses `adultCount` and `childrenAges` array; `travelerCount` is computed as `adultCount + childrenAges.length` at save time.
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — Shows trip summary (destination, dates, nights, hotel, activities) read from `localStorage`. Links to itinerary, transport, profile, and guides. PHI-60: signed-in users with more than one saved trip see a minimal switcher dropdown above the header — selecting another trip POSTs `/api/travelers/claim` with `action: "use_saved"` (idempotently flips `is_primary`), writes the chosen trip into `localStorage.rise_traveler`, and reloads. Single-trip users see no switcher and the read path is unchanged.
- **Day-by-day itinerary** (`/itinerary`) — Day-view timeline with one column per trip day, grouped by three time blocks (morning / afternoon / evening) with emoji subheadings and divider lines. AI pre-populates suggestions on first load via `/api/itinerary/generate`; persisted to `localStorage` (`rise_itinerary`). The generate API receives the user's hotel name and injects it into the prompt so activities reference the correct accommodation. Page header shows destination, date range, total days/activities, hotel name, and a "↻ Regenerate" button (with confirmation step). Sticky TripShapeBar highlights the active day via IntersectionObserver. Editing surface: (1) Remove (×) with 5-second undo toast — activity held in state, auto-dismissed after timeout; (2) Swap (⇄) — calls `/api/itinerary/edit` with mode=`swap`, shows new suggestion in place of old item for review ("Looks good ✓" / "Not quite, try again →"), inline error message on API failure; (3) "+ Suggest something" button below each time block and in empty slots — calls `/api/itinerary/edit` with mode=`add`, shows suggestion card for accept/reject review. Action buttons (swap/remove) are always visible on mobile (`opacity-100`), hover-revealed on desktop (`sm:opacity-0 sm:group-hover:opacity-100`). Old item stays visible with loading overlay during API call; new item only committed to state after user confirms. Retry accumulates `rejectedTitles` across attempts. Conflict warning from API shown as amber text. The edit API enforces a hard location constraint — suggestions must be in the destination city, never from another city even if wrong-city items appear in context.
- **Travel connectors** (`/api/itinerary/travel`, `lib/travel-connectors.ts`) — Inter-activity travel time/cost data displayed between every sequential activity pair in the itinerary timeline. User-initiated via "🗺 Calculate travel times" button in the itinerary header. Flow: (1) geocode destination city for location bias; (2) resolve each activity name to coordinates via Google Places Text Search (New); (3) compute walk/transit/drive routes via Google Routes API for each adjacent pair; (4) calculate gap from estimated time positions (block ranges: morning 09:00–12:00, afternoon 13:00–17:00, evening 18:00–21:00, split evenly per activity count); (5) apply family walk-time modifier (1.5× for children Under 2 or 2–4); (6) flag tight connections where fastest travel mode exceeds the gap. All data stored server-side in `travel_connectors` Supabase table, keyed by `traveler_id`. Persists across sessions — loaded on page revisit, only recomputed on explicit trigger. Swap/add/remove trigger targeted refresh of only the affected connectors (1–2 pairs), not the full day. Regenerate clears all connectors. Connector UI: `TravelConnectorRow` component renders between activity cards — compact row showing `🚶 12 min · 🚇 8 min · 🚕 ~2.1 km`. Three visual states: (1) normal — muted text with left-border accent; (2) flagged — amber background with "⚠ Tight connection" heading and flag reason; (3) error — red background, "Travel data unavailable". Zero-duration modes filtered from display. Within-block pairs get a 15-minute minimum gap floor to prevent false flags on short neighbourhood walks. Gap flags stored in DB and logged to `ai_logs` (feature `"travel-connectors"`) for admin visibility as a prompt quality signal — high flag rates across itineraries indicate the AI's neighbourhood-clustering instruction is failing. Admin summary endpoint at `/api/itinerary/travel/admin`. Google API costs: Places Text Search $0.032/req, Routes Compute $0.005/req; full 5-day computation ~$0.70, swap refresh ~$0.06.
- **AI activity preview + feedback** (`/api/activities-stream`, `/api/activity-chips`, `/api/activity-feedback`) — Step 4 of onboarding uses progressive card reveal: the streaming response is parsed incrementally and each complete activity card renders as an `ActivityCard` immediately (no raw markdown shown). Cards show title, category, and description (no "When:" line). Cards are interactive immediately as they stream in — thumbs are not disabled during streaming; a "Found N of ~6 activities..." progress counter shows below the last card while loading. Thumbs up/down are toggleable — tapping the active thumb deselects it (returns to neutral); tapping the other thumb switches. Selected thumbs-up renders with solid teal fill. Chips are pre-generated on card render (not on tap) by calling `/api/activity-chips` — Claude Haiku with tool_use, returns 1 hard-exclusion ("Done it before") + 3 profile-specific soft-signal reasons + 1 static "Not for me" soft-signal appended as fallback. All chips have identical unselected styling (no orange on "Done it before" until selected). FALLBACK_CHIPS (3 static chips + "Not for me") are shown immediately on thumbs-down tap; dynamic chips swap in silently once loaded (guarded by `submittedActivitiesRef` so they never disrupt in-progress interactions). Chip selection is required — a "← Undo" link closes the chip layer and returns the card to neutral (allowing a thumbs-up instead), but no skip path exists. Chip selection: hard-exclusion shows "We'll skip this." and blocks the activity; soft-signal shows "👎 Noted — we'll adjust." with an amber left border on the card. Step 5 shows a "Skipped activities" panel of hard-excluded activities with × removal buttons (logs `exclusion_removed`). All interactions (thumbs_up, chips_shown, chip_selected, exclusion_removed) are logged to `activity_feedback` via `/api/activity-feedback` with `chipsSource` (fallback/dynamic) and `firstChipLabel`. On finish, feedback saved to `rise_activity_feedback` in localStorage and consumed by `/api/itinerary/generate` with two main cases: (1) hard exclusions → "NEVER include" block; (2) soft with reason → "avoid, suggest alternatives". A "N of M rated" counter shows above the cards once the user starts rating. CTA button: disabled until at least one rating; shows "Continue with N rated — more = better results →" when fewer than half are rated, "Continue with N rated →" otherwise. Activity diversity is enforced in the stream prompt — each of the ~6 activities must come from a different category (food & dining, cultural/historic, outdoor/adventure, nightlife/entertainment, relaxation/wellness, shopping/local markets). The prompt also instructs Claude never to reference the traveller's profile or preferences in descriptions.
- **AI activity suggestions** (`/api/activities`) — POSTs destination to Claude, returns 20 categorised activities as JSON.
- **Airport → Hotel transport** (`/transport`) — Streaming AI advice comparing public transport vs taxi for a given airport/hotel/city.
- **Travel profile & restaurant recommendations** (`/profile`) — Collects traveller type, destination, dates, company, budget, dietary wishes. Streams personalised restaurant picks from Claude.
- **User feedback** (`/feedback`) — Full-page form. Page field auto-filled with current URL (editable). Saves to `user_feedback` Supabase table. Confirmation screen after submit.
- **Floating feedback button** — Fixed bottom-right on every page except `/welcome` and `/team*`. Opens a popup with textarea + send. Auto-captures current pathname. Shows "Thanks!" confirmation then closes.
- **Magic-link auth** (PHI-59, `/signin`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/check-email`) — Passwordless Supabase Auth via `@supabase/ssr` with cookie-based sessions. `/signin` collects email and calls `signInWithOtp({email, emailRedirectTo: /auth/callback?next=/dashboard})`; the user is redirected to `/auth/check-email?email=<...>` with a 30-second resend cooldown and link-expiry hints. `/auth/callback` is a Route Handler (GET) that calls `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)`, then — if the link carried a `travelerId` (set during welcome Step 5) — links the row via `update travelers set auth_user_id = <user.id> where id = <travelerId> and auth_user_id is null` (best-effort; failure doesn't lock the user out of their account). PHI-60: after the link/exchange the callback redirects to `/auth/claim?next=<next>` instead of jumping straight to the dashboard. On missing/expired code redirects to `/signin?error=expired`. Allowlisted in `middleware.ts` so the email link works even without the `site_auth` cookie. Coexists with `SITE_PASSWORD` middleware as orthogonal layers — site password gates platform access, Supabase Auth gates per-user account features. **Email template requires manual setup in Supabase dashboard** — DM Sans body, teal `#1a6b7f` CTA, subject "Sign in to Rise". Default 1h link expiry. New users are auto-created (`shouldCreateUser` defaults to `true`). No new Anthropic API calls. RLS hardening landed in PHI-61.
- **Trip claim flow** (PHI-60, `/auth/claim`, `/api/travelers/list`, `/api/travelers/claim`) — Resolves the conflict that arises when a user signs into an account that already has a saved trip while carrying a fresh local plan in `localStorage.rise_traveler`. The claim page reads the local snapshot and fetches account trips via `/api/travelers/list` (filters on `auth_user_id = auth.uid()`, ordered by `is_primary` desc then `claimed_at` desc then `created_at` desc). Short-circuits when there is nothing to resolve: empty localStorage + 0 trips → `/welcome`; empty localStorage + 1+ trips → ensure primary, hydrate `rise_traveler` from the chosen row, redirect to `next`; localStorage trip + 0 other account trips → silent `keep_local` claim, redirect. Genuine conflict (localStorage trip + at least one other account trip) renders a full-screen panel on mobile / centered modal on desktop with three buttons each showing destination + dates: **Keep this trip** (the localStorage trip — `action: "keep_local"`), **Use saved trip** (the displaced account trip — `action: "use_saved"`), **Save both** (`action: "save_both"`). Heading: "You have a trip in progress." Error toast: "Couldn't save your trip. Try again?" with Dismiss. Layout works at 360px viewport (mobile sheet uses `min-h-screen`; desktop modal uses `sm:max-w-md sm:rounded-2xl`). `/api/travelers/claim` POST handlers are all idempotent: `keep_local` and `save_both` link the local row to `auth.uid()`, set `is_primary=true`, stamp `claimed_at` (only if null), and demote every other row to `is_primary=false` — same DB outcome, label only changes how the dashboard switcher treats the displaced rows. `use_saved` promotes the chosen account row and demotes others; the client clears the local snapshot only after the API returns 200. If the localStorage trip has no backing row (e.g. the welcome row was deleted), `keep_local`/`save_both` insert a new row from the localStorage payload before promoting it. Refresh / back-button safe — every step is conditional, repeated POSTs are no-ops.

### Local guide flows
- **Browse guides** (`/guides`) — City search landing page.
- **City tips** (`/guides/[city]`) — Lists all tips for a city with guide name, reputation badge, and star rating button. Increments view count on load; awards 15 points at 10 views.
- **Submit a tip** (`/guides/add`) — Form to add a local tip. Find-or-creates guide by email in `guides` table, inserts tip with `guide_id`, awards 10 points.
- **Rate a tip** (`/api/tips/[id]/rate`) — POST inserts into `tip_ratings`, awards 25 points to the guide. Duplicate prevention via `localStorage`.
- **Leaderboard** (`/guides/leaderboard`) — Top 10 guides ranked by points with level badges.

### Reputation / points system
- Levels: 🌱 Explorer (0–49 pts) · 📍 Local (50–199) · 🔑 Insider (200–499) · ⭐ Legend (500+)
- Events: submit tip (+10), tip reaches 10 views (+15), traveller rates tip (+25)

### Admin
- **AI Logs** (`/admin`) — Table of all Claude API calls with prompt, input, output, latency, token counts, and per-log rating/notes for evaluation. Team discussion titles strip markdown asterisks from display.
- **User feedback** (`/feedback-admin`) — All `user_feedback` entries ordered by most recent, with page URL, feedback text, and date.
- **Evals** (`/admin/evals`) — Three-level evaluation framework for AI output quality. Four tabs: (1) Test cases — lists pre-seeded family prompt scenarios with criteria tags; (2) Run evals — select a test case via `CustomSelect` dropdown, run against `/api/itinerary/generate`, view output, rate 1-5 with notes, "Ask Claude to judge →" for LLM-as-judge scoring with per-criterion pass/fail breakdown; (3) Results — sortable table of all eval results (test case, model, human score, LLM score, date); (4) Model comparison — select test case + Model A/B, run both in parallel, side-by-side output with auto-judging and win/loss summary. All dropdowns use `CustomSelect` (div-based, not native select) to avoid browser event issues. Data stored in `eval_test_cases` and `eval_results` Supabase tables. Judge route at `/api/evals/judge` calls Claude with structured scoring prompt.
- **Usage** (`/admin/usage`) — API usage monitoring and limits dashboard. Two provider cards (Anthropic, Google) each showing: progress bar (spent/limit), warning level indicator (green/amber/red), current month spend, estimated month-end projection. Editable limit fields: monthly limit USD, warning threshold %, hard limit toggle — saves via `PATCH /api/usage/limits`. Recent usage log table (last 50 entries): date, provider, api_type, feature, tokens/requests, cost — sortable by date or cost.

### Product team (`/team`) — four tabs
- **Build / Research mode toggle** — Persistent toggle in the page header (all tabs). Default: Build mode. Stored in `localStorage("rise_team_mode")`. Teal dot = Build mode, amber dot = Research mode. The active mode is injected as an `IMPORTANT:` instruction into every agent system prompt: Sarah (framing, synthesis, PRD), Alex, Maya, Luca, Elena, PM Sarah, and the product coach. Build mode instructs agents to ship complete features without research gates or phased rollouts; Research mode applies standard discovery practices.
- **Card types** — Each objective has a `card_type` field: `objective` (teal), `improvement` (amber), `bug` (red). Type badges shown on kanban cards, detail panel, and PM tab objective list. `CardTypeSelector` component used when creating cards from the kanban "+ New card" form. PM tab always creates `objective` type cards.
- **Kanban tab** — Board with four columns (Backlog / Refine / Implement / Done). Status values: `backlog` | `refine` | `implement` | `done`. "+ New card" button above the board opens an inline form (title + description + type selector) for directly creating Backlog cards — Bugs and Improvements are created here without PM conversation. Cards are sourced from the `objectives` table grouped by status. Each card: type badge + title (line-clamp-2, markdown asterisks stripped), description (line-clamp-2), PRD/discussion count indicators, drag-and-drop to move between columns (HTML5 `draggable`; Done column is read-only), delete with confirmation. Clicking a card opens the Card Detail Panel (slide-in). Column highlights with `bg-[#1a6b7f]/5 ring-1 ring-[#1a6b7f]/20` on dragover. Columns use solid `border-[#c8c3bb]` borders; headers use `text-[#4a6580]`. Container uses `grid grid-cols-4` and `overflow-x-hidden` on `<main>` to prevent horizontal page scroll. `refreshKey` state triggers re-fetch when cards are modified elsewhere.
- **Card detail panel** — Slide-in panel (right side, `fixed z-50`) opened by clicking a kanban card. Shows: card title, type badge, status badge, created date, description, PM conversation summary (`pm_summary`), team discussions list (date + summary, expandable to full transcript), "Start team discussion →" button (visible for refine cards — opens full-screen modal), expandable PRD, copyable Claude Code prompt. Claude Code result textarea only shown on `implement`/`done` cards (hidden on `backlog`/`refine`). "Move to [next status] →" button with inline confirmation when moving Refine → Implement without any discussions ("No team discussion has been run for this card. Move to Implement anyway?" Yes/No). Delete button. `NEXT_STATUS` map: backlog→refine, refine→implement, implement→done.
- **Team discussion flow** — "Start team discussion →" opens a full-screen modal (`fixed inset-0 z-[60]`) containing the complete `ProductTeamTab` with card context. Full card context (`buildCardContext()`) injected into all agent system prompts: title, type, description, pm_summary, previous discussion summaries, PRD, Claude Code result. After discussion + PRD generates, "Save to card →" closes the modal and returns to the card detail panel with the new discussion visible. Discussion stored as summary + full transcript + PRD in the card's `discussions` jsonb array.
- **Alex in Build/Research mode** — In Build mode (`buildMode=true`), Alex (Researcher) is excluded from the parallel specialist calls in team discussions. Only included when `buildMode=false` (Research mode). The team roster display, synthesis prompt, PRD prompt, discussion output rendering, and download conversation contributors line all respect this flag.
- **Markdown rendering** — Agent, coach, and PM chat bubbles use the `MarkdownText` component (defined in `team/page.tsx`) to render markdown: `##`/`###` as bold headings, `**text**` as bold, `---` as horizontal rules, `-`/`*` as bullet lists, numbered lists. Kanban card titles and admin discussion titles strip `**`/`*` via `.replace(/\*+/g, "")`.
- **Product team tab** — Multi-agent discussion: Sarah (PM) frames the problem (2048 tokens), Alex/Maya/Luca/Elena respond in parallel (2048 tokens each), Sarah synthesises (4096 tokens). Generates PRD (8000 tokens). If launched from a card (`cardContext`), shows a card context banner and "Save to card →" button after completion. If launched without card context, "Save to Kanban →" creates a new card. Sarah's memory persisted in `agent_memory` table. Saves to `team_conversations` (type=`"team"`). PRD generation instructs Claude to write a Claude Code Implementation Prompt section: functional description of what to build, hard constraints on sequencing/data flow only — no acceptance criteria, copy templates, animation details, schema details, manual testing instructions, QA steps, or scenario-based testing requirements (Claude Code cannot run these; quality validation is the founder's responsibility). Synthesis and PRD generation both use `sarahSystemWithMemory` (Sarah's base system prompt + build mode instruction + rolling memory). PRD sections: Overview / Problem Statement / User Need / Proposed Solution / User Stories / Success Metrics / Technical Considerations (strategic only — no implementation details) / Risks & Open Questions / Claude Code Implementation Prompt.
- **PM tab** — 1-on-1 conversation with Sarah (PM). Chat UI with streaming responses. On mount, fetches full CLAUDE.md content from `/api/rise-context` and injects it into the system prompt. Saves conversations to `team_conversations` (type=`"pm"`). Past conversations browsable via `PastConversations`. "View Kanban →" button next to the Agreed objectives heading switches to the Kanban tab. Auto-detect objective agreement: `detectObjectiveAgreed()` checks Sarah's last message for trigger phrases ("shall we save that", "want me to add that to the kanban", etc.). When detected, an "Add to Kanban as Objective →" button appears. Clicking it auto-extracts title (max 8 words) and description (1 sentence) from the conversation via Claude, generates a 3-5 sentence `pm_summary`, and saves to `objectives` with `status="backlog"` and `card_type="objective"`. No manual input or type selector — PM conversations always create Objectives. Sarah's system prompt instructs her to use agreement phrases when an objective is agreed.
- **Product coach tab** — 1-on-1 with a product coach (Claude Opus 4.6). Full conversation history maintained; saved to `team_conversations` (type=`"coach"`).
- **Past conversations** (`PastConversations` component, used in all three chat tabs) — Expandable panel listing saved conversations. Each row has a hover-revealed `×` delete button; clicking shows inline "Delete this conversation? Yes / No" confirmation, then deletes from `team_conversations` and removes from local state. The currently active conversation cannot be deleted (no button shown, shows `· Active` label instead). Coach and PM tabs track `conversationId` in both a `useRef` (for in-flight updates) and a `useState` (to pass as `activeConversationId` prop).

### Infrastructure
- **Password protection** — Edge middleware (`middleware.ts`) redirects unauthenticated users to `/api/auth`. GET shows the form; POST sets an `httpOnly` cookie.
- **AI logging** (`lib/ai-logger.ts`) — Wraps every Claude call; logs to Supabase `ai_logs` table.
- **API usage logging** (`lib/log-api-usage.ts`, `lib/api-costs.ts`) — Every API route calls `logApiUsage()` after a successful external API call. Calculates estimated cost from pricing constants (Sonnet $3/$15 per 1M tokens, Opus $15/$75, Haiku $0.80/$4, Google Places $0.017/req, Places Text Search $0.032/req, Routes Compute $0.005/req, Geocoding $0.005/req). Inserts to `api_usage` table. `checkApiLimit(provider)` queries current month spend vs `api_limits` table, returns `{ allowed, warningLevel, percentUsed, spentUsd, limitUsd }`. Hard limit enforcement: every Anthropic route calls `checkApiLimit("anthropic")` before the API call and returns 429 if exceeded and `hard_limit_enabled` is true. The travel connectors endpoint calls `checkApiLimit("google")` before computing. Wired into: itinerary/generate, itinerary/edit, itinerary/travel, activities-stream, recommendations, transport, evals/judge, activity-chips, team/chat.
- **Travel connector logic** (`lib/travel-connectors.ts`) — Server-side functions for coordinate resolution (Google Places Text Search), route computation (Google Routes API), activity time estimation from block positions, family walk-time modifier (1.5× for Under 2 / 2–4 age bands), gap calculation with within-block minimum floor (15 min), and flag determination. `buildConnectorRow()` assembles a complete DB row from route results, gap data, and family modifier. Used exclusively by `/api/itinerary/travel`.
- **API limit banner** (`ApiLimitBanner.tsx`) — Client component in `layout.tsx` above Nav. Fetches `/api/usage/status` on mount. Amber banner at ≥80% spend ("You've used X% of your budget"), red banner when exceeded ("API limit reached. AI features are paused."). Links to `/admin/usage`. Dismissible per session via `sessionStorage`.
- **Supabase clients** — three flavours, distinct call sites:
  - `lib/supabase.ts` — anon-keyed legacy client. Now only used by API routes touching the public/community tables (`guides`, `tips`, `tip_ratings`), which have no RLS. Don't add new callers.
  - `lib/supabase-server.ts` (`getSupabaseServerClient()`) — SSR client for Route Handlers / Server Components. Carries the signed-in user's auth cookie, so RLS scopes results to `auth.uid()`. Use for read/write on user-owned tables (`travelers`, `itineraries`, `travel_connectors`) that should run as the signed-in user.
  - `lib/supabase-browser.ts` (`getSupabaseBrowserClient()`) — browser singleton for client components that need the user's session (sign-out button, OTP send).
  - `lib/supabase-admin.ts` (`getSupabaseAdminClient()`, PHI-61) — service-role client. Bypasses RLS. Use for system writes (`ai_logs`, `api_usage`, `anonymous_sessions`, `activity_feedback`, `user_feedback`, `profiles`, `itinerary_items`, telemetry) and admin-gated routes that need to read across users. Service-role key is server-only — never import this from a client component.
- **RLS policies** (PHI-61, `db/migrations/0009_rls_lockdown.sql`) — RLS is enabled on `travelers`, `itineraries`, and `travel_connectors`. Policies are scoped to `auth.uid()`: a user can read/write only the `travelers` row(s) where `auth_user_id = auth.uid()`, and child rows on `itineraries` / `travel_connectors` are reachable only via owned `traveler_id`. Pre-signup welcome rows (`auth_user_id IS NULL`) are invisible to RLS — routes that legitimately serve them (`POST /api/travelers`, `PATCH /api/travelers`, `/api/travelers/claim`, `/api/anonymous-session`) use the service-role admin client and verify ownership in code. Admin/system tables (`ai_logs`, `api_usage`, `api_limits`, `eval_*`, `team_*`, `agent_memory`, `prd_feedback`, `objectives`, `activity_feedback`, `user_feedback`, `profiles`, `anonymous_sessions`, `itinerary_items`, `guides`, `tips`, `tip_ratings`) intentionally have RLS off and rely on the service-role admin client + the site_password / ADMIN_PASSWORD perimeter for access control. **Hard constraint (PHI-67):** any **new** API route that reads or writes one of these RLS-off tables MUST use `getSupabaseAdminClient()`, never the legacy anon client (`lib/supabase.ts`) — the schema doesn't enforce, so a misrouted call is a silent bypass and the admin-client convention is the only thing standing between a future bug and a data leak. Pre-existing callers are grandfathered: the guide/tip routes (`/api/guides/*`, `/api/tips/*`) on the legacy anon client, and the `/team` browser code reading `team_conversations` / `objectives` / `agent_memory` directly. They migrate to the admin client only if those tables ever lock down with policies.
- **Server-side auth lookup** (PHI-61) — `/api/itinerary` and `/api/itinerary/travel` no longer accept a client-supplied `traveler_id`. The signed-in user's primary `travelers` row is resolved server-side from `auth.uid()` (via the SSR client) and the route runs under RLS. Anonymous callers get 401; their pre-signup itinerary lives in `localStorage` and the `anonymous_sessions` table.
- **Admin endpoints** (PHI-61) — admin pages (`/admin`, `/admin/usage`, `/admin/evals`) no longer talk to Supabase from the browser. They go through admin-gated API routes that wrap the service-role client server-side: `/api/admin/team-discussions`, `/api/admin/usage-log`, `/api/usage/limits` (GET added), `/api/admin/evals/cases`, `/api/admin/evals/results`. The team kanban (`/team`) still uses the anon client directly because its tables (`team_conversations`, `objectives`, `agent_memory`) are RLS-off; revisit if those tables ever lock down.
- **Rise context API** (`/api/rise-context`) — Server-side GET route that reads and returns `CLAUDE.md` as JSON using Node `fs`. Used by the PM tab to inject the full product context into the system prompt.
- **Traveler composition** (`lib/composition.ts`) — `buildCompositionSegment(travelerCount, childrenAges)` builds a plain-language context segment injected into every AI prompt. Translates age ranges to behavioural constraints: Under 2 → pram access required, nap windows mid-morning/afternoon, no loud environments; 2–4 → 45-min activity max, outdoor space; 5–8 → 90-min tolerance, interactive; 9–12 → near-adult stamina. Constraints are deduplicated across siblings. Used in activities-stream, itinerary/generate, itinerary/edit, recommendations, and transport routes.
- **Prompt caching** — Static system prompt instructions are separated into a `system` array with `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` on the streaming routes (activities-stream, recommendations, transport). Dynamic per-request context goes in the user message. Caches once the static portion reaches Anthropic's threshold (~1024 tokens).
- **Eval scripts** — `npm run eval:family` runs `scripts/eval-family-prompts.ts`: tests `buildCompositionSegment` against 7 family scenarios (solo, Under 2, 9–12, mixed, beach/city/adventure destinations) with 20 assertions. Exits with code 1 on failure. `npm run eval:recommendations` runs the restaurant recommendations eval. `npm run eval:location` runs `scripts/eval-itinerary-location.ts`: tests `/api/itinerary/edit` location constraint with 5 trap cases (wrong-city items in context — e.g. Eiffel Tower in Amsterdam, Pergamon Museum in Lisbon), uses Claude Sonnet as LLM-as-judge to verify suggestions stay in the destination city. Requires dev server running.

## Supabase Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `travelers` | Onboarding data — destination, dates, hotel, activities, account, traveler_count (int), children_ages (text[]), travel_company (text), style_tags (text[]), budget_tier (text), auth_user_id (uuid, FK → auth.users.id, PHI-59), is_primary (bool, default true, PHI-60), claimed_at (timestamptz, PHI-60). Name and email are nullable (collected at step 5, after row creation). `auth_user_id` is null until the user clicks the magic link; nullable so existing localStorage-only travellers keep working. PHI-60 (claim flow): a single `auth_user_id` may own multiple rows; `is_primary=true` marks the row the dashboard defaults to (claim flow ensures exactly one primary per user); `claimed_at` is stamped when the row is linked via the claim flow (null for legacy rows linked silently in PHI-59). |
| `guides` | Local guide profiles — email, name, points |
| `tips` | Guide tips — city, content, view count, guide_id |
| `tip_ratings` | One row per rating event — tip_id, value |
| `ai_logs` | Every Claude API call — prompt, input, output, latency, tokens, rating, notes |
| `team_conversations` | Product agent conversations — type (`team`/`coach`/`pm`), title, messages JSON, prd |
| `agent_memory` | Sarah's rolling memory of past product discussions — id=`"sarah"`, content |
| `prd_feedback` | Feedback on generated PRDs — conversation_id, feedback text |
| `objectives` | PM 1-on-1 agreed objectives — title, description (1-sentence), prd (full PRD text), status (`backlog`/`refine`/`implement`/`done`), card_type (`objective`/`improvement`/`bug`), pm_summary (text), claude_code_result (text), discussions (jsonb array of {date, summary, transcript, prd}) |
| `user_feedback` | Floating button + /feedback form submissions — page URL, feedback text |
| `activity_feedback` | Activity preview interaction log — event type, activity name/category, chip label/type |
| `itinerary_items` | Persisted restaurant alternatives from swap feature — item details, booking_meta, replaced_restaurant |
| `activity_feedback` | Activity preview interaction log — event, activity name/category, chip label/type, chips_source (fallback/dynamic), first_chip_label |
| `eval_test_cases` | Eval test scenarios — name, feature, inputs (jsonb), criteria (text[]). Pre-seeded with 7 family prompt scenarios |
| `eval_results` | Eval run results — test_case_id (FK), model, prompt_used, ai_output, human_score (1-5), human_notes, llm_score (1-5), llm_reasoning |
| `api_usage` | API call cost tracking — provider (`anthropic`/`google`), api_type, feature, input_tokens, output_tokens, request_count, estimated_cost_usd |
| `api_limits` | Per-provider monthly limits — provider (unique), monthly_limit_usd, warning_threshold_pct (default 80), hard_limit_enabled (default true) |
| `travel_connectors` | Inter-activity travel data — traveler_id, day_number, sequence_index, from/to activity IDs and names, from/to lat/lng, walk/transit/drive seconds and meters, walk_adjusted_seconds (family modifier), transit_fare, gap_seconds, gap_flagged (bool), flag_reason, error. Indexed on traveler_id. |

**Required SQL to add composition columns to `travelers` table:**
```sql
alter table travelers
  add column if not exists traveler_count integer,
  add column if not exists children_ages text[];
```

**PHI-59 migration — link travelers to Supabase auth users** (run once, idempotent):
```sql
alter table travelers
  add column if not exists auth_user_id uuid references auth.users(id);
create index if not exists idx_travelers_auth_user on travelers(auth_user_id);
```

**PHI-60 migration — trip claim columns** (run once, idempotent; `db/migrations/0008_traveler_claim_columns.sql`):
```sql
alter table travelers add column if not exists is_primary boolean default true;
alter table travelers add column if not exists claimed_at timestamptz;
update travelers set is_primary = true where is_primary is null;
```

**PHI-61 migration — RLS lockdown** (run once, idempotent; `db/migrations/0009_rls_lockdown.sql`):
Enables RLS on `travelers`, `itineraries`, and `travel_connectors` with policies tied to `auth.uid()`. Admin/system tables stay RLS-off and are accessed exclusively via the service-role admin client (`lib/supabase-admin.ts`). After applying, set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.local` and Vercel — the loggers and admin endpoints throw without it.

**Required SQL for `objectives` table** (run in Supabase dashboard if not yet created):
```sql
create table objectives (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  title text not null,
  description text,
  prd text,
  status text not null default 'backlog',
  card_type text default 'objective',
  pm_summary text,
  claude_code_result text,
  discussions jsonb default '[]',
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
alter table objectives add constraint objectives_status_check check (status in ('backlog', 'refine', 'implement', 'done'));
```

**Required SQL for `activity_feedback` table:**
```sql
create table activity_feedback (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  event text not null,           -- thumbs_up | chips_shown | chip_selected | thumbs_down_no_chip | exclusion_removed
  activity_id text,
  activity_name text,
  activity_category text,
  chip_label text,               -- populated for chip_selected events
  chip_type text,                -- hard_exclusion | soft_signal
  chips_source text,             -- fallback | dynamic — which chips were showing at submission
  first_chip_label text,         -- label of the first chip in the row at submission time
  metadata jsonb,                -- PHI-45: arbitrary payload from onboarding telemetry events (length, dayCount, hasActivityFeedback, clarifications, destinationCount, hadConstraints, etc.)
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

**PHI-45 migration for existing deployments** (run once, idempotent):
```sql
alter table activity_feedback
  add column if not exists metadata jsonb;
```

**Required SQL for `user_feedback` table:**
```sql
create table user_feedback (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  page text not null,
  feedback text not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

**Required SQL for `itinerary_items` table** (persists AI-generated restaurant alternatives):
```sql
create table itinerary_items (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  item_id text not null,
  title text not null,
  description text,
  item_type text not null default 'restaurant',
  time_block text not null,

  booking_meta jsonb,
  date text not null,
  day_number integer,
  destination text not null,
  replaced_restaurant text,
  is_alternative boolean default false,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
**Required SQL for eval tables:**
```sql
create table eval_test_cases (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name text not null,
  feature text not null default 'itinerary',
  inputs jsonb not null,
  criteria text[] not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table eval_results (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  test_case_id uuid references eval_test_cases(id),
  model text not null,
  prompt_used text,
  ai_output text not null,
  human_score integer,
  human_notes text,
  llm_score integer,
  llm_reasoning text,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

**Required SQL for `api_usage` and `api_limits` tables:**
```sql
create table api_usage (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  provider text not null,
  api_type text not null,
  feature text,
  input_tokens integer,
  output_tokens integer,
  request_count integer default 1,
  estimated_cost_usd numeric(10,6),
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table api_limits (

  provider text not null unique,
  monthly_limit_usd numeric(10,2) not null,
  warning_threshold_pct integer default 80,
  hard_limit_enabled boolean default true,
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

insert into api_limits (provider, monthly_limit_usd, warning_threshold_pct, hard_limit_enabled)
values ('anthropic', 20.00, 80, true), ('google', 10.00, 80, true)
on conflict (provider) do nothing;
```

**Required SQL for `team_conversations` type constraint** (add `pm` if constraint exists):

  drop constraint if exists team_conversations_type_check;
alter table team_conversations
  add constraint team_conversations_type_check
  check (type in ('team', 'coach', 'pm'));
```

```sql
create table travel_connectors (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  traveler_id uuid not null,

## Coding Conventions

### TypeScript
- Strict mode is on. No `any` unless genuinely unavoidable (e.g. runtime Google Maps types not covered by `@types/google.maps`).
- Use SDK types directly (`NextRequest`, `NextResponse`, Supabase generics). Don't redefine what the libraries already export.

### Design system (light theme)
- **Background:** `#f8f6f1` (page), `white` (cards), `#f0ede8` (subtle fills)
- **Borders:** `#e8e4de` (card borders), `#d4cfc5` (dividers/separators), `#c8c3bb` (kanban column borders)
- **Accent:** `#1a6b7f` (teal) — buttons, active states, focus rings, links
- **Text:** Three tokens defined as CSS custom properties in `app/globals.css` `:root` and consumed via Tailwind arbitrary values. Do NOT introduce new ad-hoc grey shades for text — pick the nearest token by perceptual lightness.
  - `--text-primary: #0e2a47` → `text-[var(--text-primary)]` — headings, strong text, body emphasis
  - `--text-secondary: #4a6580` → `text-[var(--text-secondary)]` — body copy, labels, sub-headings
  - `--text-muted: #5a6f7f` → `text-[var(--text-muted)]` — hints, timestamps, metadata, placeholders. Bumped from `#6a7f8f` for AA contrast on cream `#f8f6f1`.
- **Border radius:** `rounded-2xl` for cards and primary buttons, `rounded-xl` for inputs
- **Font:** DM Sans — already applied globally via `layout.tsx`. Don't add other fonts.
- Primary buttons: `bg-[#1a6b7f] text-white font-bold rounded-2xl hover:bg-[#155a6b]`
- Status badges (kanban/PM tab): Backlog `bg-[#e8f0f4] text-[#1a6b7f]`, Refine `bg-[#e8f0fb] text-[#185fa5]`, In-Progress `bg-[#fef3e2] text-[#ba7517]`, Done `bg-[#eaf4ee] text-[#2d7a4f]`

### AI / Anthropic
- Default model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- **The activity-gen prompt lives in `lib/activity-gen-prompt.ts`.** Both `app/api/activities-stream/route.ts` and `scripts/eval-activities.ts` import `ACTIVITY_GEN_SYSTEM` and `buildActivityGenUserMessage()` from there. Edit there, not in the route or the eval — they're the same string by construction (PHI-43).
- Use streaming (`client.messages.stream()`) for any response displayed progressively (recommendations, transport advice, onboarding activity preview). Use `stream.finalMessage()` to get the complete response afterwards.
- Use non-streaming (`client.messages.create()`) when the response must be parsed as structured JSON (e.g. itinerary generation). Always wrap `JSON.parse()` in try/catch and return a meaningful error.
- Always wrap Claude calls with `logAiInteraction` from `lib/ai-logger.ts` so every interaction is logged to `/admin`. Also call `logApiUsage()` from `lib/log-api-usage.ts` after each successful call for cost tracking. Call `checkApiLimit("anthropic")` at the start of each route and return 429 if exceeded.
- For welcome-flow routes (parse-trip, activities-stream, itinerary-generate), always pass `session_id: req.cookies.get("rise_session_id")?.value ?? null` to `logAiInteraction`. PHI-40 uses this to group calls by trip in the multi-leg cost report.

### Eval harnesses
- `npm run eval:parser` — runs the 50-case free-form parser eval. Run before any prompt edit in `app/api/parse-trip/route.ts`. Pass gate: ≥85% field accuracy, 100% on constraint preservation.
- `npm run eval:activities` — runs the 30-case activity-gen eval (15 single-leg + 15 multi-leg). Run before any prompt edit in `lib/activity-gen-prompt.ts`. Pass gate: ≥85% field accuracy, 0 life-impacting failures.
- `npm run eval:country-destination` (PHI-69) — runs the 10-case country → city ranking eval against `lib/destination-recommender.ts`. Covers all 10 supported countries (UK, IT, JP, TH, US, FR, ES, GR, MX, AU) plus the Marcus business-extender and Okafors multi-city honeymoon archetypes. Each case runs 3× through `getCandidates` + `rankWithHaiku` (variance handling — see PHI-42); the case score is the mean of 3 Sonnet 4.6 LLM-judge `overall` scores produced via `tool_use` against a 4-criterion rubric (location match, fit-to-profile, why-quality, no-hallucinations). **Pass gate: ≥4/5 overall AND no single case < 3/5.** The per-case floor exists so uneven failure (8 fives + 2 twos = 4.4 avg but real day-one harm) can't slip through. Failing cases are pretty-printed with country, preferences, AI top picks, and per-criterion judge breakdown. Run before any prompt edit in `lib/destination-recommender.ts` or `data/country-city-overrides.json`. Cost ~$0.60/run.
- All three evals above call the live Anthropic API and cost ~$0.60–$2 per run on Sonnet 4.6. Keep `lib/api-costs.ts` rates current.
- **`eval:activities` uses `temperature: 0.2`** (PHI-42). Default temperature gave noisy results on "every card mentions X" checks — same prompt, different runs, different failures. PHI-42 trialled `{0.2, 0.5, default}` × `{strict check, ≥(N−1) loosened check}` — temp 0.2 with the strict check produced the best result (1 life-impacting failure vs 2–3 at other configs). The dominant remaining failure is the 9-card multi-leg-allergy case where Sonnet drops the constraint mention on 1 of 9 cards stochastically; that's a model variance ceiling on this prompt, not a prompt bug. Filed as a known limitation; revisit only if traffic signals it matters in production. The production route at `app/api/activities-stream/route.ts` stays at default temperature so real users still see variation.

### Cost telemetry (PHI-40)
- `npm run report:multi-leg-cost` — reads `ai_logs`, groups by `session_id`, computes per-trip Anthropic cost, splits single-leg vs multi-leg, prints median + p95 + ratio.
- **Decision rule:** if multi-leg / single-leg median cost ratio crosses **2.5×**, revisit prompt caching, smaller-model fallback for low-stakes calls, or per-leg parallel generation. The script flags this automatically; no auto-rollback.
- Run on demand — not wired into CI. Sensible cadence: after any prompt edit in `/api/activities-stream` or `/api/itinerary/generate`, and weekly during multi-leg adoption.
- When Claude returns JSON, strip markdown code fences before parsing: `.replace(/^```(?:json)?\s*/i, "").replace(/\s*```\s*$/, "").trim()`
- Set `max_tokens` generously for structured JSON responses — truncated JSON causes parse failures. Use 8000+ for multi-day itineraries.
- JSON parse fallback: if primary parse fails, try extracting between `indexOf("{")` and `lastIndexOf("}")` before giving up.

### Supabase error logging
Supabase `PostgrestError` properties are non-enumerable — `console.error(error)` prints `{}`. Use the `dbErr()` helper in `app/team/page.tsx` to extract `.message`, `.code`, `.details`, `.hint`:
```ts
function dbErr(err: unknown): string {
  if (!err || typeof err !== "object") return String(err);
  const e = err as Record<string, unknown>;
  return [e.message, e.code, e.details, e.hint].filter(Boolean).join(" | ") || JSON.stringify(err);
}
```

### PlacesAutocomplete
- `hasTypedRef` — prevents the dropdown from opening on mount when a pre-filled value is passed in. Only flips `true` on the input's own `onChange`.
- `justSelectedRef` — suppresses the suggestions effect for one cycle after a selection is made, preventing the dropdown from reopening when `onSelect` updates the controlled value.

### Supabase
- Always import the client from `lib/supabase.ts`. Never create a new client inline.
- Use `.single()` when expecting one row; check the `error` field before using `data`.
- Points are incremented with a read-then-write pattern (read current `points`, add, write back). Good enough for MVP; migrate to Supabase RPC for production.

### Next.js / React
- Prefer Server Components by default. Add `"use client"` only when the component needs `useState`, `useEffect`, browser APIs, or event handlers.
- Page-level data fetching goes in the route handler (`/api/...`), not directly in Server Components calling Supabase.
- Use `next/link` (`Link`) for internal navigation, not `<a href>`.
- Step animations: `key={animKey}` on the container + `animate-step` CSS class triggers `fadeSlideUp` keyframe defined in `globals.css`.
- Use `AbortController` + `signal` for streaming fetch calls inside `useEffect` so the stream is cancelled cleanly on unmount or dependency change.

### localStorage keys
| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `rise_traveler` | Full traveller object (name, email, destination, dates, hotel, travelCompany, travelerCount, childrenAges, travelerTypes, budgetTier, activities) |
| `rise_onboarded` | `"true"` — gates redirect from `/welcome` to `/dashboard` |
| `rise_itinerary` | Cached `ItineraryDay[]` array — cleared and regenerated when user clicks Regenerate |
| `rise_team_mode` | `"build"` or `"research"` — persists the Build/Research mode toggle on `/team` |
| `rise_activity_feedback` | `ActivityFeedbackEntry[]` — thumbs-ups and chip selections from the activity preview; consumed by itinerary generation |

### Auth / middleware
- **Two orthogonal layers** (PHI-59):
  - **Site password gate** — `middleware.ts` + `app/api/auth/route.ts`. Cookie `site_auth` is an HMAC token (see `lib/auth.ts`); not the password itself. Gates platform access during private beta.
  - **Supabase Auth (per-user)** — `@supabase/ssr` cookie-based sessions. Gates per-user account features. New users sign up via welcome Step 5 magic link; returning users via `/signin`. Sessions live in httpOnly cookies and refresh transparently.
- The middleware matcher excludes `_next/static`, `_next/image`, `favicon.ico`, `api/auth`, and **`auth/callback`** (PHI-59 — magic-link landing must work behind the site-password gate so a user clicking the email on a fresh device doesn't lose their `code` query param).
- Use `getSupabaseServerClient()` from `lib/supabase-server.ts` in Server Components / Route Handlers when you need `auth.uid()`; use `getSupabaseBrowserClient()` from `lib/supabase-browser.ts` in client components. The legacy `supabase` export in `lib/supabase.ts` carries no auth context and is fine for non-RLS reads/writes (admin tables, anonymous-session writes, AI logs). Once PHI-C lands RLS, most callers will need to migrate.
- Email template (subject, body, CTA) is configured in the **Supabase dashboard**, not in code. It must use DM Sans body + teal `#1a6b7f` CTA per PRD; replace the default Supabase boilerplate before exposing to real users.
- `signInWithOtp` defaults to `shouldCreateUser: true` — both signin and signup go through the same flow; new users are auto-created in `auth.users` on first verification.

## Environment Variables

These must be set in `.env.local` (development) and Vercel project settings (production):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY=
SITE_PASSWORD=
ADMIN_PASSWORD=
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are exposed to the browser. Keep API keys that should stay server-side without the prefix.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (PHI-61) — service-role key from the Supabase dashboard. Server-only. Required at runtime by `lib/supabase-admin.ts`; without it the loggers (`ai_logs`, `api_usage`) and admin endpoints throw. **Never** prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` — leaking it to the browser bypasses RLS for everyone.
- `SITE_PASSWORD` — the password for the whole-site access gate. Leave unset to disable password protection entirely.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` — gate for `/admin/*` routes (set the `rise_admin` cookie to its value to authenticate). Leave unset in development to skip the gate; set it in production.
